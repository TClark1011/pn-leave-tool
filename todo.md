# TODO

## LOGIN

- Interface
  - Error Messages
    - Empty details (have specific versions for hitting login or register)
    - Credentials incorrect
  - Design
- Front end requests
- Password Resets
- Allow for login based on either email or an arbitrary username
  - Users aren't going to be able to remember their PN employee number, so requiring that to login will be very annoying

## DESIGN

- Look into colours other than main for theme palette
- Legacy support issues:
  - NONE

## FRONTEND - MISC

- Favicon
- Apple touch icon
- Page Titles (Also look into bug where IE page title is just 'Waiting for localhost', although this may go away when you run the static built app)
- Write Error Messages
- Have a message recommending people to book...
  - In advance (3+ months is preferable)
  - In blocks (minimum amount that can be requested is 7 days, ideal number is 2+ weeks)
    - That ideal number is pulled out of the air, should ask around if there is actually an existing ideal number
- Provide instructions for how users can check how much stored days of leave they have
