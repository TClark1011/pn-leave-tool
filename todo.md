# TODO

## BACKEND - GENERAL

- Implement Express Server !

## LOGIN

- Interface
  - Error Messages
    - Empty details (have specific versions for hitting login or register)
    - Credentials incorrect
  - Design
- Front end requests
- Password Resets
- Allow for login based on either email or an arbitrary username
  - Users aren't going to be able to remember their PN employee number, so requiring that to login will be very annoying

## LEAVE SUBMISSION FORM

- Datepicker
  - Once the first leave date has been selected, show a field/slider where user can input number of days they want to be on leave, then the range is generated by setting the end date to however many days have been specified after the first date.
- Fields showing dates

## DESIGN

- Look into colours other than main for theme palette
- Legacy support issues:
  - NONE

## FRONTEND - MISC

- Favicon
- Apple touch icon
- Page Titles (Also look into bug where IE page title is just 'Waiting for localhost', although this may go away when you run the static built app)
- Write Error Messages
- Have a message recommending people to book...
  - In advance (3+ months is preferable)
  - In blocks (minimum amount that can be requested is 7 days, ideal number is 2+ weeks)
    - That ideal number is pulled out of the air, should ask around if there is actually an existing ideal number
- Provide instructions for how users can check how much stored days of leave they have

## BOTH END - MISC

- Input Validation
  - Field text length
